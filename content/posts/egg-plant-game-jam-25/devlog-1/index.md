I love [eggplant podcast](https://eggplant.show).

I've been listening to it for a long time, and have spent hours listening to it while running.

I participate in a lot of game jams, but most of them have been through the internal game jams that myself and some other folks at Amazon put together.

As I was lurking around the [eggplant discord](https://discord.gg/eggplant) and noticed that the [Eggplant Game Jam #25](https://itch.io/jam/eggjam-25) started a little bit ago.
Running from 10 JAN - 11 FEB, the idea is to take inspiration from a slew of [UFO-50](https://50games.fun) games and make a fun project.

The list of games that the jam is targeting is:
* Devilition
* Kick Club
* **Avianos**
* **Mooncat**
* Bushido Ball
* Block Koala
* Camouflage
* Campanella
* Golfaria
* The Big Bell Race
* Warptank
* Waldorf's Journey

I really liked **Mooncat** and thought of making a game that takes heavy inspiration from it's controls.

I don't really remember when or how I thought of it, but I thought of **Sundog** would be a cool name for a game since it flips _moon_ and _cat_.

The idea is, you're a hotdog, escaping a hotdog cart.
The controls are like **Mooncat**, where inputs on the right make your character go right, and the inputs on the left make them go left.

I voiced the plan on Discord, and `epiblitikos` came up with this great idea:
"For some reason this hot dog wants to go to the beach: hence sundog"

I **love** this idea.

I think the 'some reason' will be a love interest (classic), and will be a cheeseburger, a hotdog, or some other type of fast food.

I'm thinking through a bit of a twist at the end, but don't want to share it here.
