        <ul>
            <li>
                Keep the large back door propped open the whole time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Char 🐺</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Char is getting old.
                Do not be alarmed if he doesn't really greet you, or is in the same spot as when you left him.
            </li>
            <li>
                Huey, or even Kitty Cat, will try to eat his food.
                Keep an eye on them when he is eating.
                He may stop eating and go outside, which is fine.
                He likely will not finish all of his food, which is also fine.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Chickens 🐓</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check for eggs🥚 in eggboxes.
            If you find an egg, 🎉 <em>congratulations</em>!
            Take it home to enjoy (there are egg boxes upstairs in kitchen).
            Unwashed eggs do not have to be refridgerated, and can be stored at room temperature for over a month.
            They must be washed before eating though.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try not to pull string too far past the hook, as it can cause the door to be stuck up.
            If it does get stuck, try jiggling the string.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Lizzy 🦎 and Luna 🐍</h2>
