                <b>Keep the large back door propped open the whole time.</b>
                <br>
                Char needs to go out too often to have it closed overnight.  I highly doubt this will be a problem.

        <h2>Huey 🐶 & Char 🐺</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There's treats in the laundry room if you want to give them some
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Char 🐺</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can give him his medicine like a treat, same with the Cosequin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Char is getting old.
                Do not be alarmed if he doesn't really greet you, or is in the same spot as when you left him.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The topper packets will likely perk up his appetite, so the following will likely not be a problem:</b>
                <br>
                  Huey, or even Kitty Cat, will try to eat his food.
                  Keep an eye on them when he is eating.
                  He may stop eating and go outside, which is fine.
                  He likely will not finish all of his food, which is also fine.
            </li>

        <h2>Chickens 🐓</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check for eggs🥚 in eggboxes.
            If you find an egg, 🎉 <em>congratulations</em>!
            Take it home to enjoy (there are egg boxes upstairs in kitchen).
            Unwashed eggs do not have to be refridgerated, and can be stored at room temperature for over a month.
            They must be washed before eating though.
          </li>
        <li>
            One of our chickens <em>loves</em> being a mommy; she'll likely be in the egg box when you go to get eggs.
            Politely reach under her and grab the eggs.
            I don't think she'll nip at you, but if she does, don't be alarmed, she can't <em>really</em> hurt you.
            If you don't feel comfortable getting them, no bigie; try again next visit :)
          </li>
          <li>
            When operating the door, try not to pull string too far past the hook, as it can cause the door to be stuck up.
            If it does get stuck, try jiggling the string.
            Or get Dave.
