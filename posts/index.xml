&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a game idea that I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You own a farm&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wait&lt;/strong>! It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> kind of game!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You own a farm and you get money each morning for each animal that spent the night in the barn, coop, shed, etc.
Something like: $2 per chicken (sell eggs), $10 per cow (sell milks), etc.
Sounds easy enough - BUT!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>There are UFOs all over the farm.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each night you need to try get your animals into the barn.
The UFOs will abduct anything under it, so you need to dodge them, try to out smart them, or maybe even sacrifice lesser animals to them.
If your animal gets abducted, you get the animal back the next day, but they did not make you any money.
If you get abducted, you don&amp;rsquo;t get any money the next day - who would have collected the eggs or milked the animals?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You use the money you earn to buy more animals, make upgrades to the farm, make upgrades to yourself, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can plant trees, bushes, or even build roofed structures to hide from the UFOs.
Hurricanes will happen sometimes overnight and break them.
UFOs can also transport aliens onto the map that will disassemble them.
This is to avoid covering the whole map with roofed structures.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="movement">Movement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Likely a top down game, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of trying to keep controls to d-pad and two buttons&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#575279;background-color:#faf4ed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>8-way directional movement
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>A Button - confirm
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>A Button - for picking up small animals, like chickens.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>A Button - attach teather to larget animals.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>B Button - cancel
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>B Button - put down animal
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>B Button - release lasso
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="details">Details&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="animals">Animals&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Chicken&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Turkey&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pig&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cow&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="player-upgrades">Player upgrades&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Faster walking speed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teather distance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster pickup animation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster put down animation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="upgrades-to-the-farm">Upgrades to the farm&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Chicken coop size&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Barn size&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Additional buildings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plant bush (X days till providing hiding spot)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plant tree (X days till providing hiding spot)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fencing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="plot">Plot&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Not much of a plot is needed here, the hope is the game loop will entice people to play.
However, in order to provide pressure, maybe there is a &amp;lsquo;Save the farm&amp;rsquo; storyline where you need to earn $X,XXX dollars in ## days or the farm is lost&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving to Hugo</title><link>https://mikepurdy.dev/posts/moving-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>michaeljosephpurdy@gmail.com (Mike Purdy)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://mikepurdy.dev/posts/moving-to-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to ditch the previous framework of this site and onboard onto Hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hope with this move is that it will reduce the friction associated with creating &amp;lsquo;content&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Content&amp;rsquo; is a weird word with a lot of odd connotations.
Does attempting to focus on creating &amp;lsquo;content&amp;rsquo; mean that I am now a &amp;lsquo;Content Creator&amp;rsquo;?
That&amp;rsquo;s not really the goal.
&lt;strong>The goal is to give myself a place to jot down my thoughts.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not have delusions that someone will actually be reading this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="previous-site">Previous site&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was previously using &lt;a href="https://nuxt.com">Nuxt&lt;/a>, which is a wrapper of sorts for Vue.
At least I think it&amp;rsquo;s something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about it.
I decided to use it because it was being used in freelancing project I was working on and it seemed like it would be a decent framework for a small static site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I came across the idea of &amp;lsquo;Atomic Design&amp;rsquo;, which you can read more here: &lt;a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com">https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com&lt;/a>.
The idea is that you break down web components into their smallest pieces (atoms), and use those atoms to build larger components (molecules), and use those to build organisms, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in November of 2020 I pushed the initial commit (&lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeljosephpurdy/michaeljosephpurdy.github.io/commit/7e8143c676c59ed690d6e94173d4e0a03fbc87a7">7e8143&lt;/a>) of the Nuxt-powered site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site has served me well, giving me a place to host my games, resume, and links to other sites (mainly itch).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="future-plans">Future plans&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I want to try to write more, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve shifted away from my custom-built solutions and onto something that is markdown-aware.
I chose Hugo because I&amp;rsquo;ve used it previously (&lt;a href="https://childinclusionfund.com">Child Inclusion Fund&lt;/a>) and like some of the themes that I come across on &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">themes.gohugo.io&lt;/a>.
Currently I am using &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/slick/">Slick&lt;/a>, though I think I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually build my own to give me what I am fully looking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="games">Games&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Previously I was building web versions of each of my games and adding them into my website repo directly.
This was a bit of a pain, but it did lead to my site actually hosting all of my web games instead of pointing to elsewhere; which was helpful for my son and his friends to play my games at their school.
Unfortunately, the school went and blocked &lt;a href="https://mikepurdy.dev">mikepurdy.dev&lt;/a>, so the ROI of adding everything onto this site decreased.
Instead, I plan on using itch.io&amp;rsquo;s widgets to link to individual games:&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="writings">Writings&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A lot of the games that I&amp;rsquo;ve made were for game jams internal to Amazon that myself and a few other folks setup.
The jam structure is usually:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Friday @ 3pm ET: A kickoff meeting where we announce the theme&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Next Friday @ 3pm ET: Closing of submissions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Next Next Friday @ 3pm ET: A showcase meeting where each person/team talk about their game, answer questions, and we announce the winners.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I find that in each showcase meeting I am &lt;strong>eager&lt;/strong> to talk about the brainstorming phase, the end result, and everything in between.
I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to channel that enthusiasm into this site, and jot down a bit about each game or maybe even low level technical decisions or implementations that I feel would would be good to talk about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to blog about game development a bit.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
