That&rsquo;s not really the goal.
<strong>The goal is to give myself a place to jot down my thoughts.</strong></p><p>I do not have delusions that someone will actually be reading this.</p><h3 id=previous-site>Previous site</h3><p>I was previously using <a href=https://nuxt.com>Nuxt</a>, which is a wrapper of sorts for Vue.
At least I think it&rsquo;s something like that.</p><p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know much about it.
I decided to use it because it was being used in freelancing project I was working on and it seemed like it would be a decent framework for a small static site.</p><p>I came across the idea of &lsquo;Atomic Design&rsquo;, which you can read more here: <a href=https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com>https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com</a>.
The idea is that you break down web components into their smallest pieces (atoms), and use those atoms to build larger components (molecules), and use those to build organisms, etc.</p><p>So in November of 2020 I pushed the initial commit (<a href=https://github.com/michaeljosephpurdy/michaeljosephpurdy.github.io/commit/7e8143c676c59ed690d6e94173d4e0a03fbc87a7>7e8143</a>) of the Nuxt-powered site.</p><p>The site has served me well, giving me a place to host my games, resume, and links to other sites (mainly itch).</p><h3 id=future-plans>Future plans</h3><p>I want to try to write more, which is why I&rsquo;ve shifted away from my custom-built solutions and onto something that is markdown-aware.
I chose Hugo because I&rsquo;ve used it previously (<a href=https://childinclusionfund.com>Child Inclusion Fund</a>) and like some of the themes that I come across on <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io>themes.gohugo.io</a>.
Currently I am using <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/slick/>Slick</a>, though I think I&rsquo;ll eventually build my own to give me what I am fully looking for.</p><h4 id=games>Games</h4><p>Previously I was building web versions of each of my games and adding them into my website repo directly.
This was a bit of a pain, but it did lead to my site actually hosting all of my web games instead of pointing to elsewhere; which was helpful for my son and his friends to play my games at their school.
Unfortunately, the school went and blocked <a href=https://mikepurdy.dev>mikepurdy.dev</a>, so the ROI of adding everything onto this site decreased.
Instead, I plan on using itch.io&rsquo;s widgets to link to individual games:</p><iframe frameborder=0 src=https://itch.io/embed/2830406 class=itch-wrapper><a href=https://purdy.itch.io/2024-summer-game-jam>A Prime Summer by mikepurdy</a></iframe><h4 id=writings>Writings</h4><p>A lot of the games that I&rsquo;ve made were for game jams internal to Amazon that myself and a few other folks setup.
The jam structure is usually:</p><ul><li>Friday @ 3pm ET: A kickoff meeting where we announce the theme</li><li>Next Friday @ 3pm ET: Closing of submissions</li><li>Next Next Friday @ 3pm ET: A showcase meeting where each person/team talk about their game, answer questions, and we announce the winners.</li></ul><p>I find that in each showcase meeting I am <strong>eager</strong> to talk about the brainstorming phase, the end result, and everything in between.
I&rsquo;m hoping to channel that enthusiasm into this site, and jot down a bit about each game or maybe even low level technical decisions or implementations that I feel would would be good to talk about.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to blog about game development a bit.</p></div></div><div class=footer><div class=footer-content><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class=pure-menu-item title=repo><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://github.com/michaeljosephpurdy>github</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title=itch.io><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://purdy.itch.io>itch.io</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="RSS Feed"><a href=/index.xml class=pure-menu-link>RSS</a></li><li class="pure-menu-item fix-cursor-pointer" title="Go to top"><a class=pure-menu-link id=btn-gototop><span class=fix-placement-up>&#8679;&#xfe0e;</span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class=footer-copyright><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class="pure-menu-item pure-menu-disabled">&copy; 2025 &mdash; Mike Purdy</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="pure-u-1-24 pure-u-md-5-24"></div></div></body></html>
